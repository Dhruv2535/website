## Backups

Please remember to take backups before upgrading Jackson. We cannot stress how important this step is, although we take precautions to avoid bugs they sometimes do slip by us. Having backups will not only help you recover from these rare events but should be part of your disaster recovery process. If you need any help around this please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
